    <!-- These are the Examples of "Body_Tag" When you write a command for the body tag than whatever
         The styles you wrote that will apply on the whole content of that body tag but
         When you give that same command from "Inside" of the any of the particular body Tag
         Then that time the same styles will apply only for that particular body tag..-->
    <h1 id="orange">Good Morning</h1>
    <h1 id="orange">Good Afternoon</h1>
    <h1 id="orange">Good Evening</h1>

    <!-- Styles will apply but the Problem is of "Code_Duplication" that's why we use
         "CLASS_TAG".. In "Class Tag" there is no limitation of duplication of same id
         you can use it not only for one but for more than one... -->


    <!-- These are the Example of "Class_Tag"-->

    <h1 class="blue">Welcome to the world of Technology</h1>
    <h1 class="blue">Welcome to the world of Technology</h1>
    <h1 class="blue">Welcome to the world of Technology</h1>
    <h1 class="blue">Welcome to the world of Technology</h1>

    <!-- *NOTE:- While writing a style always first priority goes to "INLINE" Attribute
          Means whatever you write a command for ur web if you use inline command for any
          of your commanded tag, then first priority goes to inline command..
          but still it is not recommended to use because in this command it becomes the
          Mixture of both "HTML" and "CSS" and if you use more command for other changeg
          then it gets complex to find where you write the HTML command or CSS command
          at the time of recheck..
          Always Second Priority goes to "ID_Tags".. It means if you use "ID_Tags" and
         "Class_Tags" together for the same paragraph of something in which you want to
          make some change then the second priority always goes to "ID_TAGS"..
          At the very last "CLASS_TAGS" Comes, and if you use class tags to make some change
          in the design of a particular portion or paragraph then you will have to always
          Remember these things that always "LATEST" change will have the priority whether you
          write the same and not deleted the previous command, but in process of make change
          always the latest data will apply to that particular subjects. -->
